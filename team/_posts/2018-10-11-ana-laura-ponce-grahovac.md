I am an undergraduate student from the Psychology Degree in the National University of Córdoba. I am generally interested in Cognitive and Affective Neurosciences. My interests in this field are more related with psychophysiology and neuropsychology. During my second degree year i had the opportunity to learn how to manipulate an Eyetracker equipment. At present, im looking forward to learn about different techniques to measure signals of the nervous system, as the programing of behavioral experiments combined with others tecnologies as electroencephalography.
