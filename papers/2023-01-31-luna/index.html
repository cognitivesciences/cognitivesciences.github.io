<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>Attentional networks are regulated by three independent but interacting sub-systems, i.e., alertness and vigilance, orienting, and executive control. While most of the studies analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs) of attentional networks focused on classic attentional functions (i.e., phasic alertness, orienting, and executive control), ERPs associated with vigilance were measured in separated studies and with different behavioral paradigms. The present study aimed at determining ERPs related to attentional and vigilance components of the attentional networks system. Forty participants (34 women, age: M = 25.96; SD = 4.96) completed two experimental sessions wherein electroencephalographic signal was recorded while they completed the Attentional Networks Test for Interactions and Vigilance â€“ executive and arousal components, a behavioral task suitable for measuring the independence and interactions of the classic attentional components as well as the executive (i.e., the ability to detect infrequent critical signals) and arousal (i.e., the capacity to sustain a fast reaction to environmental stimuli) vigilance components. Independent ERPs previously reported for the classic attentional components were replicated here: (a) N1, P2, and contingent negative variation for phasic alertness; (b) P1, N1, and P3 for orienting; and (c) N2 and slow positivity for executive control. Importantly, vigilance components were associated with different ERPs: while the executive vigilance decrement was associated with an increase in P3 and slow positivity across time-on-task, reduced arousal vigilance was associated with reduced N1 and P2 amplitude. The present study provides novel and high-powered evidence about specific neural mechanisms underlying multiple components of the attentional networks system.</p>
