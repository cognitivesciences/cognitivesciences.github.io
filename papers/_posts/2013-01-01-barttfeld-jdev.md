# Abstract

Background: The dimensional approach to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) considers ASD as the extreme of a
dimension traversing through the entire population. We explored the potential utility of electroencephalography
(EEG) functional connectivity as a biomarker. We hypothesized that individual differences in autistic traits of typical
subjects would involve a long-range connectivity diminution within the delta band.
Methods: Resting-state EEG functional connectivity was measured for 74 neurotypical subjects. All participants also
provided a questionnaire (Social Responsiveness Scale, SRS) that was completed by an informant who knows the
participant in social settings. We conducted multivariate regression between the SRS score and functional
connectivity in all EEG frequency bands. We explored modulations of network graph metrics characterizing the
optimality of a network using the SRS score.
Results: Our results show a decay in functional connectivity mainly within the delta and theta bands (the lower
part of the EEG spectrum) associated with an increasing number of autistic traits. When inspecting the impact of
autistic traits on the global organization of the functional network, we found that the optimal properties of the
network are inversely related to the number of autistic traits, suggesting that the autistic dimension, throughout
the entire population, modulates the efficiency of functional brain networks.
Conclusions: EEG functional connectivity at low frequencies and its associated network properties may be
associated with some autistic traits in the general population.
