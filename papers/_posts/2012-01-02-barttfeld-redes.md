# Abstract

Anatomical and functional brain studies have converged to the hypothesis that autism spectrum
disorders (ASD) are associated with atypical connectivity. Using a modified resting-state paradigm to
drive subjects’ attention, we provide evidence of a very marked interaction between ASD brain
functional connectivity and cognitive state. We show that functional connectivity changes in opposite
ways in ASD and typicals as attention shifts from external world towards one’s body generated
information. Furthermore, ASD subject alter more markedly than typicals their connectivity across
cognitive states. Using differences in brain connectivity across conditions, we ranked brain regions
according to their classification power. Anterior insula and dorsal-anterior cingulate cortex were the
regions that better characterize ASD differences with typical subjects across conditions, and this effect
was modulated by ASD severity. These results pave the path for diagnosis of mental pathologies based
on functional brain networks obtained from a library of mental states.
